SquareFFx
=========

A simple Stylish script that makes your Firefox look nicer, in my opinion.

Changelog
---------
#### 1.1
Added hiding new tab button via CSS.
Changed color of finished download button to stay white (tab bar, perhaps change this to be more general)



### Installation 

1. Install [Stylish][1] extension for Firefox.
2. Install SquareFFx as a Stylish script.
3. Customize as you see fit, such as moving URL bar to the tab bar.

#### To Do:
- (Unplanned) minor quality of life changes in the future
- Adding it to userstyles.org
- Adding link to userstyles for one-click install

##### Thanks
I shamelessly took parts of Stylish scripts and hacked them together.  This is probably not the most original Stylish script because of the simplicity.  Thanks to everyone's scripts I've peeked on at userstyles.org.
